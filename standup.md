## 🗓️ What I did yesterday

- Cloned the Lab 2 repo from GitHub and mirror-pushed it to the new Lab 3 repository
- Published the GitHub Pages site successfully at `https://jungwonkim.github.io/sp25-cse110-lab3`
- Set up the project structure and confirmed all files transferred properly
- Created custom issue labels and set up an issue template under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/lab-task.md`
- Created initial issues to break down Lab 3 into smaller, trackable tasks

## 🔧 What I’m working on today

- Starting on HTML/CSS structure improvements for the meeting minutes page
- Implementing Flexbox layout to separate header, sidebar, and main content
- Writing media queries for responsiveness on small screens
- Creating a new section using CSS Grid to demonstrate layout skills

---

## 🧱 What blockers or challenges I’m facing

- `:has()` selector is not working properly in Firefox, even though it’s supported — looking into fallback behavior or testing in Chrome instead
- CSS Validator throws warnings for newer features — need to document which warnings are acceptable
- Deciding where to place inline styles for meaningful contrast with external and `<style>` block

---

## 🧠 What I learned

- How to use `git push --mirror` safely and the importance of checking remote URLs before pushing
- Learned about the difference between various CSS layout methods (flexbox vs grid)
- Discovered `color-mix()` and CSS variables with fallback, which I plan to incorporate for theming

## 💬 Questions / Discussion Topics

- Do we need to use separate GitHub Issues for each minor task (e.g., every selector), or can we batch them into logical groups?
- Would it be better to demonstrate Grid layout in a new section (e.g., attendance) or restructure existing content?
