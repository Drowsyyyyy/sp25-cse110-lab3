# 🧑‍💻 Standup Note — April 22, 2025

## What I worked on
- Styled header and footer using external, inline, and internal CSS
- Implemented Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Added `:has()` and nested selectors
- Created media queries for small screens
- Validated CSS using W3C validator

## What I’m working on today
- Finalizing README.md and validation screenshots
- Reviewing checklist one last time

## Blockers
- `color-mix()` caused validator warning (fixed with fallback)
- Nested `&` selector not valid in raw CSS (replaced with standard selectors)

## What I learned
- How to use `:has()` effectively
- Full box model (shorthand vs longhand)
- GitHub workflow of branching + PR + issue linking
